## Why is this open source suddenly?
We planned on releasing Puniemu when it was somewhat fully playable, however, we are simply too busy to work on it consistently, and thought it would be best to show what we have so far while we are slowly improving it.

## What is this? ðŸ‘€

Essentially, this is a private server for *Yo-kai Watch Puni Puni* written in C#. It can be hosted by anyone, anywhere as a drop-in replacement for NHN's servers. This allows everyone to play even after the servers shut down. Additionally, you can have full control over your experience by modifying the code.

## DISCLAIMERS ðŸš«
